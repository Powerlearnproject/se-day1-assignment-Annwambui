Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software using engineering principles.
Importance
1.It enables building of systems that are reliable.
2.It enables development of systems that can adapt and grow.
3.Secure systems can be built to secure user data.
4.It enables the development of new products and services such as startups.
5.It helps drive innovation across various fields.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The creation of the term software engineering in the nato conference in 1968. This marked the beginning of structured software development methodologies.
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s - 1980s). Traditional programming methods became inefficient for large-scale systems hence Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software more reusable, and scalable.  
 The Emergence of Agile and DevOps (2000s - Present). The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced principles emphasizing collaboration and flexibility. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban became widely adopted.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
Defines project goals, scope, feasibility, and resource allocation.
2. Requirements Analysis
Gathers and documents user and system requirements.
3. Design
Creates system architecture, data models, and UI/UX designs.
4. Implementation (Coding/Development)
Developers write and integrate code using programming languages and frameworks.
5. Testing
Involves unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
6. Deployment
The software is released to users in a live environment.
7. Maintenance and Support
Fixes bugs, updates software, and enhances performance based on user feedback.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall approach is sequential and linear while agile is Iterative and incremental.
Waterfall is rigid, while Agile is	highly flexible.
In Waterfall, project Phases, each phase (e.g., planning, design, development, testing) is completed before moving to the next while in Agile	Work is divided into small cycles (sprints), with continuous feedback
Extensive documentation is required in Waterfall before development while in Agile Documentation is minimal, focusing more on working software.
Customer Involvement in Waterfall is limited to initial planning and final product delivery while there is continuous customer feedback throughout the development process in Agile.
In Waterfall Testing is done after development is complete while continuous testing is done during development in Agile.

Examples:
Waterfall is used in Healthcare or banking software where strict regulatory compliance and documentation are needed.
Agile is used for Mobile app development where user feedback influences frequent updates.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
