Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software using engineering principles.
Importance
1.It enables building of systems that are reliable.
2.It enables development of systems that can adapt and grow.
3.Secure systems can be built to secure user data.
4.It enables the development of new products and services such as startups.
5.It helps drive innovation across various fields.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The creation of the term software engineering in the nato conference in 1968. This marked the beginning of structured software development methodologies.
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s - 1980s). Traditional programming methods became inefficient for large-scale systems hence Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software more reusable, and scalable.  
The Emergence of Agile and DevOps (2000s - Present). The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced principles emphasizing collaboration and flexibility. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban became widely adopted.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
Defines project goals, scope, feasibility, and resource allocation.
2. Requirements Analysis
Gathers and documents user and system requirements.
3. Design
Creates system architecture, data models, and UI/UX designs.
4. Implementation (Coding/Development)
Developers write and integrate code using programming languages and frameworks.
5. Testing
Involves unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
6. Deployment
The software is released to users in a live environment.
7. Maintenance and Support
Fixes bugs, updates software, and enhances performance based on user feedback.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall approach is sequential and linear while agile is Iterative and incremental.
Waterfall is rigid, while Agile is	highly flexible.
In Waterfall, project Phases, each phase (e.g., planning, design, development, testing) is completed before moving to the next while in Agile	Work is divided into small cycles (sprints), with continuous feedback
Extensive documentation is required in Waterfall before development while in Agile Documentation is minimal, focusing more on working software.
Customer Involvement in Waterfall is limited to initial planning and final product delivery while there is continuous customer feedback throughout the development process in Agile.
In Waterfall Testing is done after development is complete while continuous testing is done during development in Agile.

Examples:
Waterfall is used in Healthcare or banking software where strict regulatory compliance and documentation are needed.
Agile is used for Mobile app development where user feedback influences frequent updates.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software applications. A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards and functions correctly before deployment. A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of a software project while ensuring alignment with business goals.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for writing, debugging, and testing code in one place. It is important because it increases Productivity, enhances Code Quality, streamlines Development and supports multiple Languages.
Example - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that tracks changes to code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently while maintaining a history of modifications. It Facilitates Collaboration, Tracks Changes & Rollbacks,  Ensures Code Integrity and supports Branching & Merging.
Example - Git and Github.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and complex, especially in large codebases. Solution is to use debugging tools.
2.Quick fixes and rushed development can lead to poorly structured code that becomes harder to maintain. Solution is to follow clean code principles (e.g., meaningful variable names, modular functions) and allocate time for refactoring to improve code quality.
3.Poor security practices can lead to data breaches, hacking, and compliance failures. Solution is to follow secure coding guidelines.
 Implement data encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms and regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.
4.Unrealistic deadlines, scope creep, or poor time management can lead to stress and burnout. Solution is to  Use Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) to break tasks into smaller, manageable parts


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of the software to ensure they work as expected in isolation. It typically tests a single "unit" of code.
Importance:
Early Detection of Bugs, Code Reliability and facilitates Refactoring 

Integration testing checks how different modules or components of the system work together. It focuses on verifying interactions between integrated units, ensuring they collaborate as expected.
importance:
Detects Interface Issues, Verifies Data Flow 

System testing involves testing the complete software system as a whole. This phase evaluates the entire applicationâ€™s functionality, performance, security, and overall behavior to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Importance:
End-to-End Verification, Comprehensive Validation.

Acceptance testing (often user acceptance testing or UAT) is performed to verify that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for release to end-users. It is typically done by the end users or stakeholders.
Importance: Ensures Usability


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and crafting input prompts to effectively interact with AI models.
Importance:
1.Improves Response Quality
2.Maximizes AI Efficiency
3.Minimizes Errors and Misunderstandings


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about the history of computers."
Improved Prompt:
"Provide a brief overview of the key milestones in the history of computers, from the invention of the first computer to the development of personal computers in the 20th century."
